        p.body-2.ma-a.mt-2 Calculating water loss in a hot tub uses the same formula as volume of a hot tub.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference is that, instead of using the average depth of the hot tub, we use the depth of the water that was lost.
        p.body-2.ma-a.mt-2 Since the amount of water lost is usually in inches we need to convert inches to feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Feet = Inches / 12
