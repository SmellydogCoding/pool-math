      p.mt-2 The part of the sand fiter that does the filtering is the top of the sand bed inside the filter.
      p.mt-2 If you look at a sand filter from above it looks like a big circle, therefore we calculate the surface area of a sand filter using surface area of a circle&nbsp;&nbsp;You remember how to calculate the surface area of a circular hot tub from Section 2 right?&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the same formula:
      p.blue--text.darken-4 Radius x Radius X 3.14 = Surface Area (Ft&sup2;)
      p For example, sand filter has a diameter of 5ft (remember that the Radius is 1/2 of the Diameter) the Surface Area of this filter is 19.6ft&sup2;: #[span.blue--text.darken-4 2.5 feet x 2.5 feet x 3.14 = 16.9ft&sup2;]
